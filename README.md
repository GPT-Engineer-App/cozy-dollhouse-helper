# cozy-dollhouse-helper

an ai chatbot th Marshallat is custom designed to help me 81 year old mother finish the autobiographical book she is writing. Her name is Carol F. Marshall and the app ui should be designed like a little girl's dollhouse, a homemade dollhouse with a second floor and windows and a door. Carol should be warmly invited to copy and paste either text or files including images, and the ai will help her edit it into e-pub format and help improve her old photos, and talk to her like an old friend and take her by the hand technologically, make everything super ultra intuitive and obvious and easy.
